## REACT Bike Rental
 
 This React project uses React-Redux to store the state of the components, in this case the data stored using redux was the available inventory (bike types, accessories, etc) and the Check-Out information for the customers. I believe the integration of Redux is a good solution for this project because it will allow us to expand/scale the application, think about this:
 - easier component integration (maybe you want to include extra features such as a "summary page" or a "editable shopping  cart")
